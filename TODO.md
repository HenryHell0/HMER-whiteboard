NEXT TIME:

- start on solving (scary)

### Other stuff TODO:

## COOL OTHER STUFF TO DO!!!

- 8 UNDO and REDO button!
- 8 editable expression component!
- 4 make a robust way to that when you do something with an expression it loads and then does it
- 4 make it so that hovering over a graph with an expression makes it blur or something so its obvious you can drag it
- 4 an info/credits button in the right
- 2 add different settings for the tools that pop down in a different menu (stoke width, color, etc. ) - make it cute
- 2 a little tutorial when you start
- 1 switch HMER select button to having a little AI star

Graphs:

- 4 QOL make it so that you can drag an expression from one graph to another
- 4 QOL EASY make it so that you can drag another graph with only one expression onto a graph to add it
- 6 make it so that hovering a graph with an expression blurs/makes it clear you can drop it in. noone will know you can do that.
- also consider (later) making it so that you can select a portion of the graph to set the bounds

DONE:

- 9 feature - make the expression you drag to go on top
- easy - make it so that hovering while holding an expression gives a nice background
