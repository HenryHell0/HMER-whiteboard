NEXT TIME:
- finish graphs (finally) w/ colors 
migrate to typescript

### Other stuff TODO:

- add different settings for the tools that pop down in a different menu (stoke width, color, etc. ) - make it cute

## COOL OTHER STUFF TO DO!!!

- 8 UNDO and REDO button!
- 8 editable expression component!
- 4 make a robust way to that when you do something with an expression it loads and then does it
- 4 make it so that hovering over a graph with an expression makes it blur or something so its obvious you can drag it
- 4 an info/credits button in the right
- 2 a little tutorial when you start
- 2 switch HMER select button to having a little AI star

Graphs:

- make it so the padding color is the color of the graph!! (use desmos pallete option too, also make it so you can show/hide graphs!, and import/export)
- also consider (later) making it so that you can select a portion of the graph to set the bounds


DONE:

- 9 feature - make the expression you drag to go on top
- easy - make it so that hovering while holding an expression gives a nice background
