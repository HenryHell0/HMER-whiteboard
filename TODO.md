### Other stuff TODO:

- add different settings for the tools that pop down in a different menu (stoke width, color, etc. ) - make it cute

## COOL OTHER STUFF TO DO!!!

- 8 feature - UNDO and REDO button!
- 8 feature - editable expression component!
- 4 polish(sorta) - make a robust way to that when you do something with an expression it loads and then does it
- 4 polish - make it so that hovering over a graph with an expression makes it blur or something so its obvious you can drag it
- 4 polish - an info/credits button in the right
- 2 polish - a little tutorial when you start
- 2 polish - switch HMER select button to having a little AI star

Graphs:

- make it so that removing an equation turns it back into an expression or deletes it (user chooses)
- make it so the padding color is the color of the graph!! (use desmos pallete option too, also make it so you can show/hide graphs!, and import/export)



DONE:

- 9 feature - make the expression you drag to go on top
- easy - make it so that hovering while holding an expression gives a nice background
